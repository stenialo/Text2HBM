Remove the detergent drawer.
Soak it in hot water and use an old toothbrush to remove any residue or mould.
Rinse it thoroughly and let it dry before putting it back.
Set the machine for a hot or sanitising cycle and add a cup of white vinegar to the drum. The vinegar will help to sanitise your machine.
Let the cycle finish.
Open the door and air-dry the inside of the drum.
If any bad odour or residue remains, repeat the process.
Finally, take a damp cloth and wipe around the rubber seals of the machine.
Wipe the surfaces of your machine, too.
The washing machine should now smell fresh and clean.
