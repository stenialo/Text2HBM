Ingredients:
   1 cup (190 g) sushi rice (glutinous rice)
   2.5 tablespoons (37 mL) rice vinegar
   1/2 tablespoon granulate white sugar
   1/2 teaspoon salt
   1.25 cups (300 mL) water
   1 sheet nori (dried seaweed)
   1–2 ounces (28–57 g) cucumber, avocado, daikon radish sprouts, or other assorted vegetables
   1–2 ounces (28–57 g) fresh sushi-grade fish (tuna, salmon, yellowtail, etc.)
   Toasted sesame seeds (for uramaki-style rolls)
Combine 1 cup (190-285 g) of sushi rice and 1.25 cups (300 mL) of water in a rice cooker. Stir the ingredients until they’re thoroughly mixed, then close the lid and hit the start button. 
Wait 15-20 minutes to finish.
Heat vinegar, sugar, and salt together in a small saucepan.
Add your seasoning mixture to the cooked rice and let it cool.
Cut your filling ingredients into small pieces.
Place a sheet of nori on your rolling mat with the shiny side down.
Wet your fingers to keep the rice from sticking to them as you work.
Spread a thin layer of sushi rice onto the sheet of nori.
Make a shallow depression near the bottom of the rice with your finger.
Add roughly 2 ounces (57 g) of filling ingredients to the rice.
Roll the sushi up from the bottom using your mat as a guide.
Cut your roll into 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) pieces.
Serve your roll with other toppings and condiments of your choosing.
