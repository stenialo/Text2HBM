Ingredients:
	1 cup white rice
	2 cups water
	3 Tbsp rice wine vinegar
	2 Tbsp sugar
	1/2 tsp salt
	4 sheets nori
	1 cup chopped veggies (carrot, cucumber, red pepper, avocado)
	Soy sauce/tamari, pickled ginger
Rinse rice in a fine mesh strainer until the water runs clear.
Add to a medium saucepan with water and bring to a boil.
Once it boils reduce heat to low, cover and cook until water is completely absorbed.
Wait 15 minutes.
Add vinegar, sugar and salt to a small saucepan and heat over medium heat.
Place in a jar or dish and cool in the fridge.
Once the rice is done, turn off the heating and add the cooled vinegar mixture and stir.
Prepare the vegetables by chopping them into thin pieces.
Fold a thick towel into a rectangle and place it on a flat surface.
Top with plastic wrap, then with a sheet of nori.
Using hands dipped in water, pat a very thin layer of rice all over the nori.
Arrange a serving of your veggies.
Start to roll the nori and rice over with the fingers.
Once the veggies are covered, roll over the plastic wrap and towel, using it to shape and compress the roll.
Slice with a sharp knife and set aside.
Serve immediately with pickled ginger, soyasauce.
