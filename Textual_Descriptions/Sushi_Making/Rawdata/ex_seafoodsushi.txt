Ingredients:
   2 boiled shrimp
   2 tuna slices
   2 salmon slices
   4 1/4 ounces (120 grams) of sushi rice
   1/2 teaspoons of wasabi paste (for each nigiri piece)
   2 cups (475 ml) of su water (add a dash of rice vinegar to regular water - this acts as a disinfectant)
Cut each piece of seafood into small and thin slices.
Dip your hands in the su water and make sure to keep them wet.
Take a small amount of sushi rice (about 3/4 the size of your palm).
Place a dab of wasabi on one side of the fish slice and then place the fish on the rice "log", with the wasabi side on the rice.
Shape both items together. Hold the tuna and rice in your left hand and use two fingers from your right hand to press the fish downwards and shape it in a rounded rectangle.
Repeat the process using the salmon and shrimp.
Garnish and serve the nigiri sushi.
