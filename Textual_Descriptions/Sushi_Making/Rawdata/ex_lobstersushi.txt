Ingredients:
   1 cup sushi rice
   Pinch of salt
   2 tablespoons seasoned rice vinegar
   1 tablespoon honey
   8 ounces (1½ cups) cooked lobster meat, cut into bite-sized pieces
   3 tablespoons mayonnaise
   1½ teaspoons chilli garlic sauce
   3 sheets nori
   6 steamed asparagus spears
   1 large ripe avocado, pitted and cut into 12 slices
   Soy sauce

Boil and cook the sushi rice and salt by following the package instructions.
In a small bowl, whisk the honey and vinegar until well-combined.
Pour the honey mixture over the rice and mix with a wooden spoon.
Allow the rice to sit for about 10 minutes.
In a separate bowl, mix the chilli, garlic, lobster, and mayonnaise.
Lay a bamboo sushi mat on a clean work surface.
Lay a piece of nori on the mat.
Wet your hands and sprinkle ⅓ of the rice over the nori.
Sprinkle ⅓ of the lobster mixture over the rice.
Lay two asparagus pieces and four avocado slices on the nori.
Hold the two edges of the nori and roll it into the shape of a 'log'.
Repeat with the other two nori sheets to form three rolls.
Using a sharp knife, slice the rolls into 8 sushi pieces on a cutting board.
Serve.
