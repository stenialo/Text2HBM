Ingredients:
   1¼ cups butter, softened
   1 cup white sugar
   ⅔ cup brown sugar
   2 eggs
   1 teaspoon vanilla
   3¼ cups flour
   4 packages (or ¾ cups) hot cocoa mix
   1 teaspoon salt
   1¼ teaspoon baking soda
   1 teaspoon baking powder
   1 cup chocolate chips
   1 cup mini marshmallows
Heat oven to 350° Fahrenheit (176° Celsius).
Cover a baking sheet with a parchment paper.
Cream the butter, brown sugar, and white sugar using an electric mixer. 
In a separate bowl, mix the dry ingredients. Mix the flour, hot cocoa, salt, baking soda, and baking powder.
Pour in the dry ingredients and blend on a low speed for about two minutes, until the cookie dough is a dark brown and there are no flour streaks.
Fold in the chocolate chips and marshmallows.
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and allow the cookie dough to chill for about one hour.
Using a mini ice cream scoop, drop the cookie dough onto the baking sheet.
Bake the cookies for about 9-11 minutes, until the marshmallows melt and the cookies become slightly brown.
Allow the cookies to cool on a wire rack for about 5-7 minutes.
Serve.
