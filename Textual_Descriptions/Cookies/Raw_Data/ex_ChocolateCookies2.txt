Ingredients:
	1 cup white sugar (200 grams)
	⅓ cup brown sugar (75 grams)
	½ teaspoon salt
	1 ½ eggs (less egg yolk results in light and fluffy dough)
	1 cup of butter (between refrigerator and room temperature) (227g/8oz)
	2 ¼ cups of flour (adapt this for elevation and humidity as needed, make sure the cups are level (?)) (288 grams / 10 ounces)
	1 teaspoon baking soda
	1 teaspoon vanilla extract
	2 tablespoons milk
	2 cups of chocolate chips (less if large)

Heat the oven to 350ºF/180ºC.
Add the vanilla, sugar, brown sugar, eggs, and butter to a bowl.
Whisk flour, salt, and baking soda in another bowl.
Mix dry and wet ingredients until fully blended, without over-mixing.
Apply cooking spray to the pan so that the cookies won't stick to the baking pan.
Take a small quantity of your cookie dough and roll it in you hands into a ball shape. 
Place the cookie balls on the baking pan.
Flatten each cookie dough ball with a fork.
Put cookies in the oven for about 8-10 minutes.
Take the cookies out of the oven and let them sit on a wire cooling rack for about 15 minutes to cool.
Store in an airtight container or eat the cookies once they are cooled.
