Ingredients:
   2 egg whites
   1/2 teaspoon (2.2 grams) vanilla extract
   1/2 teaspoon. (2.2 grams) almond extract
   3 tablespoons (41 grams) vegetable oil
   8 tablespoons (62.5 grams) flour
   1 1/2 teaspoon (4 grams) cornstarch
   1/4 teaspoon (1.5 grams) salt
   8 tablespoons (100 grams) sugar
   3 teaspoons (15 grams) water
Measure out strips for your fortunes on a piece of paper.
Heat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
Beat the egg white in a bowl. Add vanilla extract, almond extract and vegetable oil.
Put flour, cornstarch, sugar, and salt into a separate bowl. Stir in the water.
Add the flour, cornstarch, sugar, and salt mixture into the egg, vanilla, and almond mixture.
Stir until you have a smooth batter.
Place tablespoons of batter onto the cookie sheet, spacing them around 2 or 3 inches (5 - 7.5cm) apart.
Bake for 15 minutes, or until the outer half turns to a golden brown color, and they are easy to remove from the baking sheet.
Remove the cookie with a spatula, and flip it over in your hand. Place the fortune in the middle of the cookie.
Form the fortune cookie shape: fold the cookie in half, then gently pull the edges downward over the rim of a glass or wooden spoon.
Place the finished cookie in the cup of a muffin tin or teacup or whatever you think will work best so that it keeps its shape. Continue with the rest of the cookies.
Finished.
