Ingredients:
    2 large ripe bananas
    1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
    1 egg
    3 egg whites
    3/4 cup low-fat milk
    8 slices homemade-quality white bread
    1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
Make the egg mixture. In a food processor or blender, combine the milk, egg, egg whites, bananas, and vanilla.
Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle on a medium-high heat.
Soak the bread in the egg batter and allow the bread to absorb the mixture.
Cook the bread in the skillet, until browned on both sides.
Garnish the French toast with a sprinkle of cinnamon.
