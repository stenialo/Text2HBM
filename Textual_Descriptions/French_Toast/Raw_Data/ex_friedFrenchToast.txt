Ingredients:
     1 egg for every 2 slices of bread
     Non-stick spray, olive oil, or butter/margarine
     Cinnamon, season to taste
     1/2 tsp (3 ml) vanilla extract (vanilla essence, optional) or almond essence
     Bread (make only 2 slices at a time, so as not to overcrowd the pan); the type of bread is up to you.
     Desired toppings
     Milk (depending on number of eggs, 2 tablespoons per egg)
Set the stove or electric pan to medium high heat.
Crack eggs into a bowl
Add milk, vanilla extract, and cinnamon.
Turn the heat down to medium-low, once the pan is heated sufficiently.
Dip the bread into the egg mixture.
Coat a slice of the bread with the mixture on both sides.
Place each slice onto the pan.
Cook the toast until golden on both sides.
Put the toast on a plate
