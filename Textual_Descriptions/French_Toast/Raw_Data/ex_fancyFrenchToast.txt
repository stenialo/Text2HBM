Cut thick pieces of country bread, at least an inch thick.
Add as many eggs you need into a bowl.
Add in one third of milk to the eggs.
Add a teaspoon of vanilla, quarter of a teaspoon of allspice, and half a teaspoon of cinnamon.
Add a pinch of salt.
Mix the mixture until nice and creamy.
We take our bread, soak it in the mixture one at a time, just kind of pile it up. Then put it in the refrigerator.
Soaking period lasts for 30 minutes. After the bread is done soaking, dip them in the mixture once more.
Once the bread is done soaking, we're going to brown it. Take a nice large skillet, and melt in a few table spoons of whole butter.
Put the bread on the skillet. Medium-low is perfect, medium can be fine too.
Make sure that the sides are brown. Two minutes on each side is best.
After they've been browned, transfer them to your baking sheet. The oven is going to have to be 400 degrees
Cook the bread for 10-12 minutes.
For the final touch, slowly drip maple syrup on the French toast.
