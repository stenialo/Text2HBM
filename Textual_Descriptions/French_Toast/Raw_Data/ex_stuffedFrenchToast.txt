Ingredients:
   3 tablespoons (45 mL) jam
   6 slices bread, 1.5 in (3.8 cm) each
   3 tablespoons (45 mL) cream cheese, softened
   6 eggs
   1 cup (250 mL) milk
   2 teaspoons (10 mL) cinnamon
   1 teaspoon (5 mL) vanilla (optional)
   1 tablespoon (15 g) butter
Select and slice bread. Use homemade bread, if possible, such as white bread, braided challah bread, or French bread. Slice the bread into six slices.
Combine the filling ingredients in a sealable bag or piping bag.
Stuff the bread with filling.
Dip the bread in the egg mixture. In a bowl, whisk together a batter of eggs, milk, cinnamon, and vanilla, if desired. Coat the bread on both sides.
Cook each pocket for about four minutes on each side.
Dress and serve the bread.
