Ingredients:
	2 bananas, peeled and thinly sliced
	8 slices challah bread
	2 large eggs
	1/2 cup milk
	1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
	1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
	A pinch of nutmeg
	2 tablespoons unsalted butter
	2 cups cornflakes, coarsely crushed
	1 cup Fisher Nuts Pecan Halves, chopped
	2 tablespoons confectioners sugar
To make the coating, combine cornflakes and pecans; set aside.
Divide the banana slices among four slices of the bread, and then top with remaining bread slices to make 4 sandwiches.
In a large bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg.
Working one at a time, dip sandwiches into the egg mixture, then dredge in the cornflakes mixture, pressing to coat.
Melt butter in a large skillet over medium high heat.
Working in batches, add sandwiches to the skillet, 1-2 at a time, and cook until evenly golden brown and crispy, about 2-3 minutes on each side.
Serve immediately, garnished with confectionersâ€™ sugar, if desired.
