Ingredients:
	6 eggs
	5 1/2 teaspoons white sugar
	1/4 teaspoon salt
	2 cups milk
	1 cup all-purpose flour
	2 quarts vegetable oil for frying
	8 thick slices (1-inch thick) French bread

Beat the eggs, sugar, and salt together in a mixing bowl. Whisk in the milk, followed by the flour; whisk until smooth.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
Soak the bread slices thoroughly in the egg mixture. 
Wipe off the excess egg. 
Cook in the deep-fryer several pieces at a time to avoid overcrowding.
Cook until golden brown on both sides and no longer soggy in the center, about 4 minutes. 
Drain the French toast on a paper towel-lined plate before serving.
