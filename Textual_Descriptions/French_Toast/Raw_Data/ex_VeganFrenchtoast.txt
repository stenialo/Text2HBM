Ingredients:
     6 thick slices of day old white bread
     3 tbsp. vegan butter
     1 3/4 cups soy milk (or 1 cup coconut milk with 3/4 cup soy milk for a richer flavour)
     3 tbsp. Ener-G Egg Replacer (or other similar substitute)
     2 tbsp. maple syrup
     3/4 tsp. cinnamon
     1/4 tsp. vanilla extract
Heat a nonstick or clad-iron skillet on your stove at medium heat.
Mix together the milk, Egg Replacer, maple syrup, and vanilla in a large bowl.
Melt the butter to the skillet over medium heat.
Soak the bread in the milk mixture.
Immediately place the bread into the hot skillet, browning both sides (about 2 minutes per side).
Remove the french toast from the pan using the spatula and place on a plate to cool.
Add fresh berries, shaved coconut, or a drizzle of warm maple syrup, if desired.
