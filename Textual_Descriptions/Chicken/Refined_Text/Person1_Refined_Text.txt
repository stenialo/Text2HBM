About 2 cups of chicken stock or broth.
1 Tablespoon each of butter and flour for thickening the gravy.

Steps to Make It

Heat your oven to 425 F.
Remove the neck from the chicken's body cavity. 
Remove the giblets from the chicken's body cavity. 
Pat the bird dry inside with paper towels.
Pat the bird dry out with paper towels.
Smear the outside of the chicken with butter.
Smear the inside of the chicken with butter.
Then season with kosher salt inside. 
Then season with kosher salt out.
Then season with freshly ground black pepper inside.
Then season with freshly ground black pepper out.
Truss the chicken securely with cooking twine. This step is optional, but it will help your roasted chicken cook more evenly.
Roughly chop about half an onion. 
Chop a single celery stalk. 
Chop a single medium carrot. 
Scatter these chopped vegetables at the bottom of a roasting pan. 
Set a roasting rack over the chopped vegetables. 
Place the chicken breast-side-up onto the rack.
Put the roasting pan into the oven. 
After the chicken has roasted for an hour and 15 minutes, check the temperature with an instant-read thermometer inserted into the deepest part of the thigh.
The thermometer should read at least 165 F. 
When the chicken is done, remove the roasting pan from the oven. 
Carefully lift out the rack with the roasted chicken on it.
Put the chicken on a clean cutting board.
Let it rest there uncovered for 20 minutes.
Place the roasting pan with the roasted vegetables on the stovetop.
Add a tablespoon of butter. 
Heat over medium heat until the butter melts.
Add a tablespoon of flour.
Stir to form a paste. 
Now pour about 2 cups of chicken stock or broth into the pan.
Stir to combine. 
Bring to a simmer over medium heat until reduced.
Bring to a simmer over medium heat until thickened.
Now strain the gravy through a mesh strainer. 
Season it kosher salt and black pepper.
