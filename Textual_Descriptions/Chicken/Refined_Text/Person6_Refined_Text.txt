Ingredients

4 boneless skinless chicken breast halves (about 6 ounces each).
Salt and pepper, to taste.
2 tablespoons olive oil.
1 tablespoon butter.


Steps to Make It


To prevent the thin end of a chicken breast from drying out, or the thick end from being undercooked, ensure that the chicken breasts are of even thickness.
To do so, place your chicken between two pieces of plastic wrap on top of a cutting board. 
Pound the chicken to 1/2-in. 
Season the chicken breasts on both sides with salt.
Season with pepper.
Season with other dry seasonings you like. 
In a skillet large enough to hold all of the chicken without overlapping, heat the olive oil and butter on medium heat. 
Add your chicken to the pan and cook for 5-6 minutes. 
Do not move the chicken around the pan, as it may cause the breasts to stick to the pan and rip.
Flip the chicken and cook for an additional 5-6 minutes.
Your chicken breasts will be cooked through and food-safe when their internal temperature has reached 165¡F. 
To check, take the temperature with an instant-read thermometer. 
Simply insert the thermometer halfway into each chicken breast until the temperature is displayed.
When cooked through, remove the chicken breasts from the pan.
Allow them to rest on a plate for 5 minutes. 
This lets the chicken breasts' juices to redistribute, helping to keep them in after meat is cut.
