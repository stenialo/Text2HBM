Steps to Make It

Place boneless, skinless chicken breasts on the bottom of a wide saute pan or skillet with high sides. 
Add enough water so that you cover the chicken breasts with at least 2 inches of water.
Add some chopped onion, carrot, and celery, as well as some fresh herbs like thyme or tarragon, along with a bay leaf and a few whole black peppercorns.  
Add a tablespoon of Kosher salt.
Bring the water to a boil, then lower it to a simmer.
You should see a few gentle bubbles rise up from time to time, but it should not be at a full rolling boil.
Simmer for about 10 minutes, then turn off the heat, cover the pot tightly, and let the chicken breasts stand in the hot water for another 15 to 20 minutes until completely cooked through. 
After 15 to 20 minutes, remove the chicken breasts and either serve right away or pull/shred/chop them into pieces and refrigerate.
