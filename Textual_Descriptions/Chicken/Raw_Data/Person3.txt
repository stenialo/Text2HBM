Steps to Make It

To make the marinade, combine the soy sauce, garlic, vinegar, honey, ginger, onions, sesame oil and sesame seeds in a large plastic zipper bag. 
Add the chicken breasts, squeeze any excess air out of the bag and seal tightly. 
Transfer the bag to the refrigerator for 30 to 60 minutes.
Remove it from the fridge 20 minutes before start cooking. 
Prepare a grill or grill pan by spraying with a bit of canola cooking spray.
Remove chicken from the marinade.
Grill 6 minutes per side, until tender and fully cooked. 
Garnish with cilantro leaves.
