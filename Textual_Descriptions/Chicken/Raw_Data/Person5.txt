Steps to Make It


Heat the oven to 325 F.
Make sure to use an oven-safe pan.
Place boneless, skinless chicken breasts on the bottom of a wide saute pan or skillet with high sides.
Add enough water to cover the chicken breasts with at least 2 inches of water.
Add some chopped onion, carrot, and celery, as well as some fresh herbs like thyme or tarragon, along with a bay leaf and a few whole black peppercorns. 
Add a tablespoon of Kosher salt.
Place the pan over medium-high heat, bring the water to a boil, then lower the heat to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes.
Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and put it into the oven.
Poach the chicken breasts in the oven for about 15 minutes, then remove and either serve or store
