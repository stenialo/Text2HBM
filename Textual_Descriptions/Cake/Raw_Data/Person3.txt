Ingredients

3 tablespoons butter, softened.
1/4 cup white sugar.

1 teaspoon vanilla extract.
1/4 cup milk.
1/2 cup all-purpose flour.
2 tablespoons cocoa powder.
1/4 teaspoon baking powder.
1 pinch salt

Steps to Make It

Spray a medium microwave-safe bowl with non-stick spray and set aside. 
In a mixing bowl, combine the butter, sugar, egg, vanilla extract, and milk; blend together. 
Combine the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder and salt; blend into the mixture until smooth.
Pour into greased bowl.
Cover and cook in the microwave on high for 2 to 2 1/2 minutes, or until cake springs back when touched.
To serve, let the cake cool five minutes.
Then cover the bowl with a plate and turn both bowl and plate upside down so the cake falls onto the plate.
