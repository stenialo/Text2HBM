Ingredients

1/4 cup melted butter (50 g).
1/4 cup sugar (50 g).
1/2 cup flour (50 g).
1/2 teaspoon baking powder.
1 egg.
2 tablespoons milk.

Steps to Make It

Melt butter in a medium-sized bowl.
Then add in the sugar and whisk until well combined.
Add in the baking powder, flour, eggs, and milk and whisk until you get smooth and creamy texture. 
Spray your ramekins with cooking spray, and then fill them a little over halfway.
Tap the ramekins on the counter to knock out any air bubbles.
Cover them with a piece of saran wrap.
Cook in the microwave for 50-60 seconds.
Once it's cooked, take off the plastic wrap and pop the cake out onto a plate.
