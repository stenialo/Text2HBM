Steps to Make It

Take a large bowl and mix all purpose flour (maida), salt, baking powder and baking soda in a bowl.
Take another bowl and beat eggs, then add powdered sugar.
Pour the beaten eggs and vanilla essence in the batter and stir well. Ensure no lumps are formed.
Add the maida and mix well.
Pour milk and mix until all ingredients are combined well.
Take a baking tray and grease with butter and pour the mixture into it.
Place the tray in a microwave oven and bake for 30 minutes or until the cake rises to the top and turns slightly brownish. 
To ensure that the cake is baked well by inserting a knife or toothpick, if it comes out clean, then your cake is ready.
