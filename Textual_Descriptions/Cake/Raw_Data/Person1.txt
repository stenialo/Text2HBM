Ingredients

1/2 pound (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened.
1 cup sugar.
2 teaspoons vanilla extract.
5 large eggs, at room temperature.
2 cups cake flour (spoon flour into dry-measure cup and level off), sifted after measuring.
One 9 x 5 x 3-inch loaf pan, buttered and bottom lined with parchment or foil.


Steps to Make It

Set rack in the oven and heat to 325 degrees.
Place the butter and sugar in the bowl of a heavy-duty mixer and beat on medium speed with the paddle attachment until very light, about 5 minutes. 
Beat in the vanilla. 
Beat in 3 eggs, one at a time, beating until smooth after adding each.
After adding each egg and smoothing the batter, reduce the mixer speed to low and add one-third of the flour and smooth it too.
Stop the mixer occasionally to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula.
Use the rubber spatula to give a final mix to the batter, then scrape it into the prepared pan and smooth the top.
Bake for about 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours, or until the cake has risen, cracked on top, well-colored and a toothpick inserted inside emerges dry.
Cool the cake in the pan for a few minutes, then unmold it onto a rack and turn right side up to finish cooling.
