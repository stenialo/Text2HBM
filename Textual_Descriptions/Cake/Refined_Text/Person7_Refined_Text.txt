Ingredients


1.5 cup Self-rising flour.
1/2 cup Unsweetened cocoa powder.
3/4 teaspoon Baking powder.
A pinch of Salt.
1 cup Oil.
1.5 cup Vegan Milk or Regular Milk.
1 cup Sugar + 1 tablespoon Brown sugar.


Steps to Make It

Take a large bowl.
Add Self-rising flour.
Add cocoa powder.
Add Baking powder.
Add Salt.
Combine.
Sift through a strainer. 
Add sugar.
Add milk.
Add oil.
Whisk for 2-4 minutes till everything is well blended.
Grease a round microwavable bowl.
Make sure the bowl is half filled as there should be room left for the cake to rise. 
Pick up the bowl and gently tap it on the counter to release all the trapped bubbles.
Place your bowl in the microwave.
Set the timer to 7 minutes on high power.
Since the bowl is deep we can use a skewer in the cake to check for doneness.
It came out all clean.
Place a plate underneath the cake bowl.
Flip it over.
