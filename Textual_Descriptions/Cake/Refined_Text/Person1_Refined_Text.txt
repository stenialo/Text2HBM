Ingredients

1/2 pound (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened.
1 cup sugar.
2 teaspoons vanilla extract.

2 cups cake flour (spoon flour into dry-measure cup and level off), sifted after measuring.
One 9 x 5 x 3-inch loaf pan, buttered and bottom lined with parchment or foil.


Steps to Make It

Set rack in the middle of the oven.
Heat oven to 325 degrees.
Place the butter in the bowl of a heavy-duty mixer. 
Place  sugar in the bowl of a heavy-duty mixer. 
Beat on medium speed with the paddle attachment until very light, about 5 minutes. 
Beat in the vanilla. 
Beat in the first egg, beating until smooth.
Reduce the mixer speed to low.
Beat in one-third of the flour.
Then add another egg, beating until smooth. 
Stop the mixer occasionally.
Scrape the bottom of the bowl with a rubber spatula.
Scrape the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula.
Beat in another third of the flour.
After the flour has been absorbed, beat in the final egg. 
Scrape again.
Beat in the rest of the flour.
Use the rubber spatula to give a final mix to the batter. 
Then scrape it into the prepared pan.
Smooth the top.
Bake for about 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours, or until the cake is well risen, cracked on top, well-colored and a toothpick inserted inside emerges dry.
Cool the cake in the pan for a few minutes. 
Unmold it onto a rack.
Turn right side up to finish cooling.
