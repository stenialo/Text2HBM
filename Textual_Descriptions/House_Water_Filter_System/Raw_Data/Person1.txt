Sand the burrs of both ends of the cut pipe.
Remove any debris from inside the pipe.
Install one shut-off valve on either side of the system for ease of maintenance.

Shut all valves.
For monitoring input and output pressure install a pressure gauge next to each shut-off valve.
Attach a piece of plywood to the back wall for easier mounting.
Make sure that the in and out ports are pointing the right direction for install the system.
Apply teflon tape on all threaded ends for sealing which helps to prevent leaks.
Avoid overtighting of any plastic fittings to prevent cracks.
Turn the water back on.
Open all valves except for the bypass.
